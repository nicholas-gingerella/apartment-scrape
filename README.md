# Apartment Scraper

Looking through apartment listings can be fairly tiring. Wouldn't it be nice to get updates on apartments in areas you are interested, in price ranges your are interested in?

Wait, what do you mean that already exists in A LOT apps, both mobile and web?

You say what I'm doing has been done 100 times over and that I bring nothing new to the table except for a bunch of hastily written python scripts to act as yet more clutter to the digital jungle that is the internet?

...Well...too bad!

I needed some excuse for a project to get my feet wet with web scraping, databases, json transforms, and whatever other corporate buzzwords that exist to make me sound like a competent developer that deserves absurd amounts of money!

**Steps**

1. run `craigslist_scrape.py`

   * scrape craigslist for apartment listings
   * collect those listings into a json file

2. update a database (Postgress) with listings in json file

   "What do you mean why am I using a relational database for this? Why not a document model database like Mongo?

   F*** you, that's why!"

   Just because of that, I'll use *TWO* database, Mongo *AND* Postgress, because why not try out two different databases!

   *Don't make me add a Redis cache to this! so help me, I'll do it, I SWEAR!* 

3. ???

   Are you stupid? This isn't going to make you jack diddly.
   But hey, at least it's a learning experience! (Pats self on back)
